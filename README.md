On the left is the search bar that allows for the user to search for a city by
clicking on the search button or by hitting enter.

Once a city is searched its information is cached for later comparison, you can
click on the title of the search and get the information again without querying
the API if you so desire

## Installation

webserver of your choice to host it on your own domain
